Like most web designers, I want text to adjust to the available space. Type should not be too large on small screens or too small on large screens, which is where responsive typography comes in. However, when using the zoom functionality in different desktop browsers, seemingly unpredictable jumps in font-size occur. Or zooming in appears to slow down or cease responding, and in some cases text size decreases as you zoom in. I wanted to understand the cause of this issue, so I wrote this article to share what I learned.

Responsive typography offers two techniques: static and fluid. Static responsive typography is based on a set of breakpoints, where each breakpoint triggers a new font size. This can be an effective way to ensure text looks good, but it is limited in that it only adjusts when the viewport crosses a breakpoint, while it ignores the changes between breakpoints. Fluid typography, however, allows for a more dynamic approach. It uses a mathematical formula to adjust font sizes as the viewport changes, allowing for a more natural display of typography across all viewport widths. Iâ€™ll look at both techniques and examine how they respond when zooming.

## What happens when zooming

Zooming on webkit and chromium based browsers changes the device pixel ratio. The device pixel ratio is the ratio between CSS pixels and device pixels. On a retina display the device pixel ratio is 2, meaning 1 CSS pixel is 2 device pixels. When you zoom in the device pixel ratio increases, making CSS pixels larger. Pretty much like how the CSS scale property works. When you zoom in to 500% 1 CSS pixel is now 10 device pixels. The same CSS pixel value now represents a larger area on the screen. This is why zooming in makes everything larger, including text. Even when declaraing everything in static pixels. Everything... except for the viewport, which actually gets smaller. Because there are now 5 times less pixels to fill up the viewport it is now 5 times smaller. So zooming in on to 500% on a 1920px wide window makes the viewport 1920px / 5 = 384px wide.

Here's a pixel to demonstrate this; try zooming in on it on a webkit or chromium based browser. On Chrome you can zoom in to 500%. At that point the pixel will be 5 times as wide. Take a screenshot if you don't believe me.

import Pixel from "../../components/Demos/ResponsiveType/Pixel.svelte";

<Pixel />

If you're viewing this on firefox there's a good chance the pixel doesn't get larger. That's because Firefox has a setting to zoom text only. If you disable that setting zooming works the same as webkit and chromium browsers. When enabled there's some kind of black magic going on. I haven't figured out what it actually does and how this affects responsive typography.

I'm not advocating against responsive or fluid typography. I just wanted to know what actually happens. So I took a deep dive.

This could as well be seen as a feature and not a bug. Is it really broken? What looks more broken to you?

Everybody is looking at the maximum font-size. At a window width of 1680px the font-size without zooming is 48px so we expect that this value should increase according to the zoom level. But what if we didn't implement any responsive typography and just left the font-size at 32px? Zooming in to 400% would equal to a font-size of 128px. And there wouldn't be a problem. Using the fluid clamp formula zooming in to 400% would produce a font-size of 138px which is indeed only 287.5% of 48px but it's also 431.25% of 32px. So just because we chose to implement fluid typography there's now an accessibility problem.

As long as the computed font-size after zooming is larger than the minimum font-size I don't see a problem.

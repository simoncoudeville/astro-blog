Welcome to my new blog about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## Theme icon component

import ThemeIcon from "../../components/ThemeIcon.astro";

<ThemeIcon />

## Greeting component

import Greeting from "../../components/Greeting.jsx";

<Greeting client:load messages={["Hej", "Hallo", "Hola", "Habari"]} />

## Syntax highlighting

```css
h1 {
  margin: 1rem 0;
  font-size: 2.5rem;
}
```

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

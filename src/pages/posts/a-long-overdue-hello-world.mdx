Welcome to my new blog about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website. scripts per component that just work. It allows me to make a component and write the markup, styles and script in one document. If I include the component it just works. In Eleventy I was trying to figure out a system how to do that. scripts per component that just work. It allows me to make a component and write the markup, styles and script in one document.

## Pro's

Syntax highlighting out of the box

scripts per component that just work. It allows me to make a component and write the markup, styles and script in one document. If I include the component it just works. In Eleventy I was trying to figure out a system how to do that.

## Cons

It took me a long time to find out how to make global and reusable variables, parameters and functions. For example I needed a standard wy of formatting dates on a blog detail and list. I had to look in the code of templates to find out how it's done. Right now I have a simple typescript config file that looks like this:

```typescript
export const SITE_ATHOUR = "Simon Coudeville";

// a function tho set the dates to .toLocaleDateString("en-gb").replace(/\//g, "-")
export const formatDate = (date: string | number | Date) => {
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString("en-gb").replace(/\//g, " - ");
};

export default formatDate;
```

No way to control url output at the time of writing. So the file name has to be the exact url.

Harder to write date for example

Look up stuff, when you type astro

In my case at the time of writing the homepage is the latest post. Since I'm using MDX it was a bit hard to include the whole post `<Content />` without running into issues. For some reason

In every SSG I tried there was at least one issue I ran into that I didn't like.

## Greeting component

import Greeting from "../../components/Greeting.jsx";

<Greeting client:load messages={["Hej", "Hallo", "Hola", "Habari"]} />

import Colors from "../../components/Demos/Colors.astro";

<Colors />

## Syntax highlighting

```css
:root {
  --color: blue;
  --space: calc(2rem * 2);
}

h1 {
  margin: 1rem 0;
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  font-feature-settings: "zero", "tnum", "case";
}

/* comment */

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  --color: hsl(330 100% 100%);
}

*,
::before,
::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 46.5em) {
  html {
    font-size: calc(19 / 16 * 100%);
  }
}

.class {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

```javascript
// a variable of js-page-header's height in pixels
let pageHeaderHeight =
  document.querySelector(".js-page-header").offsetHeight.toString() + "px";

function checkInView(element, className, treshold, rootMargin) {
  let observer = new IntersectionObserver(
    function (entries) {
      entries.forEach(function (entry) {
        if (entry.isIntersecting === false) {
          element.classList.add(className);
        } else {
          element.classList.remove(className);
        }
      });
    },
    {
      threshold: [treshold],
      rootMargin: [rootMargin],
    }
  );
  observer.observe(element);
}
```

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

Every once and a while you see a website that has a custom cursor. Something like a little dot that follows your cursor around the screen and changes color or grows when you hover interactive elements. Especially on sites like awwwards there ar plenty of examples with a variety of this effects. While the implications on accessibility and usability are surely debatable, it's still a neat trick to play with.

When inspecting these websites I always found there's a fair amount of javaScript that is used to create the effect. I started wondering if it was possible to create this effect with as little javaScript as possible. Of course there's some javaScript needed to get the mouse position and apply it to the cursor. And these days with CSS custom properties we can pass the mouse coordinates as variables and let CSS do the rest. But what about mouse interactions such as hover or active? Well, we can use the `:has` pseudo-class to check if the cursor is hovering over an element and apply different styles to the custom cursor. This way we can create a custom cursor that changes size and color when hovering over links or buttons, without the need for any JavaScript.

The :has pseudo-class is a powerful tool that allows us to select elements based on their children or descendants. This means we can apply styles to the custom cursor based on the state of the element it is hovering over. For example, we can use `:has(:is(a:hover, button:hover))` to check if the cursor is hovering over an anchor or button element and apply different styles to the cursor.

The `:has` pseudo-class is called the "parent selector" because it allows us to select a parent element based on its children. In most cases it's used to select a parent based on its direct children. But the implications of this selector are much greater. By chaining selectors together we can select elements based on other elements that are nowhere near each other by going up the document tree and down again. That's why it is sometimes called the "god selector". 

It's a neat effect. I'm not here to tell you if you should do it or not. I'm just here to show you how to do it.
When inspecting these websites, you'll notice that they use a custom element that follows the cursor.

This is a post with a custom cursor hover effect. It uses the `:has` pseudo-class to apply a custom cursor to the `a` element when it is hovered over.

The basic setup is to add an empty `<div class="cursor"></div>` element at the end of the body. This makes sure the cursor is always on top of other elements by default.

You could add a `z-index` to the cursor, but this is only necessary if you already have elements with a higher `z-index` on the page.

The javascript is pretty simple. We just need to get the mouse position and apply it to the document root as CSS custom properties. I'm adding px to the end of the values to make sure they can be used as CSS values. You could to that in CSS as well.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--mx", e.clientX + "px");
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--my", e.clientY + "px");
});
```

That’s all the JavaScript we need to let the custom cursor follow the mouse. We can now use the `--mx` and `--my` properties to position the cursor with CSS. Since the custom properties update when the mouse moves, the cursor will follow the mouse when we use them in the `top` and `left` properties. Or we can use the `translate` property to position the cursor.

```css
.cursor {
  --cursor-diameter: 20px;
  width: var(--cursor-diameter);
  aspect-ratio: 1;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: indigo;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  /* use translate to substract the diameter directly */
  translate: calc(var(--mx) - var(--cursor-diameter) / 2) calc(
      var(--my) - var(--cursor-diameter) / 2
    );
  will-change: scale, opacity;
  transition: 0.25s ease;
  transition-property: scale, opacity;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

I'm using custom properties to set the width and height of the cursor. This makes it easy to change the size of the cursor in one place. To position the cursor in the middle of the mouse, I'm using the `calc` function to subtract half the width and height from the mouse position.

```css
body:has(:is(a:hover, button:hover)) .cursor {
  scale: 2;
  opacity: 0.75;
}

body:has(:is(a:active, button:active)) .cursor {
  scale: 1.5;
  opacity: 0.75;
}
```

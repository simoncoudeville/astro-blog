If you're reading this I've finally done it, I posted my first personal blogpost.
It's taken me 15 years to finally take the step. Writing this text was the hardest thing I have ever done. Even now I'm fiddeling with the code and design instead of just writing.
Even when I was writing this I started to code a way to balance the text of the titles of blogposts individually. (It involves setting a custom property through the post's frontmatter). So you see the main problem is that I really enjoy the design and coding part. Building it.

When I was a kid I really loved playing with Lego. With every set there used to be an alternative design you could build. According to my mother I would build the main design and the moment it was finished I would just take it apart and make the alternative design. I wouldn't even play with it. That's exaclty what's happening with this blog. Since I first started to think about having a blog I've only been building it. First with Hugo, then Zola and also Eleventy. I've had a working version with every tool but then lost interest and started again with an alternative tool. Allways fiddling with different designs and cleaning up the code. A long the way new CSS features were released and I wanted to try them out. So I would start over again, but this time with CSS grid and custom properties. Never completely happy with the result. Never really finishing it. I reallize now that finishing it doesn't mean it's done. It's just the start. I'm going to keep building on it and making it better. I'm going to start playing with it.

## Astro

When building this website I kept struggling with the same issue: how to handle specific javascript for indivdual posts. I know I want to embed interacti demo's instead of using codepen or something like that. I have nothing against those services, but I wanted to have full control over the code and the styling.
I also wanted to get better at writing and handling javascript.

## Design

Welcome to my new blog about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website. scripts per component that just work. It allows me to make a component and write the markup, styles and script in one document. If I include the component it just works. In Eleventy I was trying to figure out a system how to do that. scripts per component that just work. It allows me to make a component and write the markup, styles and script in one document.

## Pro's

Syntax highlighting out of the box

scripts per component that just work. It allows me to make a component and write the markup, styles and script in one document. If I include the component it just works. In Eleventy I was trying to figure out a system how to do that.

PostCSS out of the box.

I haven't written Sass in a long time.
With that I can write stuff like this in my css:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: var(--mct-font-size-xl);
  line-height: calc(var(--mct-baseline) * 7);

  @media (--bp2) {
    font-size: var(--mct-font-size-xxl);
    line-height: calc(var(--mct-baseline) * 8);
  }
}
```

## Cons

It took me a long time to find out how to make global and reusable variables, parameters and functions. For example I needed a standard wy of formatting dates on a blog detail and list. I had to look in the code of templates to find out how it's done. Right now I have a simple typescript config file that looks like this:

```typescript
export const SITE_ATHOUR = "Simon Coudeville";

// a function tho set the dates to .toLocaleDateString("en-gb").replace(/\//g, "-")
export const formatDate = (date: string | number | Date) => {
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString("en-gb").replace(/\//g, " - ");
};

export default formatDate;
```

No way to control url output at the time of writing. So the file name has to be the exact url.

Harder to write date for example

Look up stuff, when you type astro

In my case at the time of writing the homepage is the latest post. Since I'm using MDX it was a bit hard to include the whole post `<Content />` without running into issues. For some reason

In every SSG I tried there was at least one issue I ran into that I didn't like.

import Note from "../../components/Note.svelte";

<Note title="Test">
  I'm using pixels in this article's demos because it's simpler to explain.
  Using relative units makes the calculations more complicated. And in the end,
  browsers turn everything into pixels anyway.
</Note>

import Colors from "../../components/Demos/Colors.astro";

<Colors />

## Syntax highlighting

```css
:root {
  --color: blue;
  --space: calc(2rem * 2);
}

h1 {
  margin: 1rem 0;
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  font-feature-settings: "zero", "tnum", "case";
}

/* comment */

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  --color: hsl(330 100% 100%);
}

*,
::before,
::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 46.5em) {
  html {
    font-size: calc(19 / 16 * 100%);
  }
}

.class {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

```javascript
// a variable of js-page-header's height in pixels
let pageHeaderHeight =
  document.querySelector(".js-page-header").offsetHeight.toString() + "px";

function checkInView(element, className, treshold, rootMargin) {
  let observer = new IntersectionObserver(
    function (entries) {
      entries.forEach(function (entry) {
        if (entry.isIntersecting === false) {
          element.classList.add(className);
        } else {
          element.classList.remove(className);
        }
      });
    },
    {
      threshold: [treshold],
      rootMargin: [rootMargin],
    }
  );
  observer.observe(element);
}
```

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

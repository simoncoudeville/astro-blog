When I was a kid I used to build Lego sets. I would spend hours building them following the instructions to the letter. In my memory every lego set had an alternative design you could build. According to my mom, as soon as I finished building the main design, I would take it apart and build the other version. Never really playing with the finished set. That's exactly what happened with this blog. I've been thinking about having a personal blog for years. But every time I started building it, I would get bored and start over with a different tool or design. First with Hugo, then Eleventy and many other static site generators and finally Astro. I've had a working version with every tool but then lost interest and started over again. Always fiddling with different designs and changing the code. A long the way new CSS features were released and I wanted to try them out. So I would start over again, but this time with CSS grid and custom properties. Never completely happy with the result. Never really finishing it. I realize now that finishing it doesn't mean it's done. It's just the start. I'm going to keep building on it and making it better. I'm going to start playing with it.

## What's next

I mean to write on this blog regularly. I have a few ideas for posts already. Mostly about CSS and web design. With CSS evolving so rapidly, there are always new things to explore and share. In the age of AI it may seem a bit odd to start writing about these topics. But I think there will always be a need for people who understand the web and how to build for it. We should stay one step ahead of the machines.

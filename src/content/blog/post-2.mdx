I'm a big fan of fluid typography. It's a great way to make your website look good on any screen size. But how does it work exactly? I've been wondering about this for a while, so I decided to make a visualisation of how it works. The fluid typography technique has undergone some changes. The first iteration didn't work well on mobile devices. The second iteration was better, but it still had some issues. The third iteration is the best one yet. It's the one I'm using on this website. I'll explain how it works in this post.

I tend to align all my text to a baseline grid. What I mean by that is that I use a consistent line height on and spacing between elements to create a sense of order and consistency in my design. The way I do this is by setting the line height of the body text to a multiple of the base font size and then using that same multiple for the margin between elements.

I've been doing this for a while now and I think it's a great way to make your text look more polished and professional. However, it can be a bit tricky to get everything to align perfectly, especially when you're working with fluid typography. In this post, I'll show you how to align it to a baseline grid using the `rlh` unit and the `round()` function.

## Baseline grid

A baseline grid is a series of horizontal lines that all your text sits on. It helps to create a sense of order and consistency in your design. The idea is that all your text should align to these lines, which makes your design look more polished and professional. Here's an example of a baseline grid:

```css
body {
  line-height: 1.5;
}

p {
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}
```

This is the most easy way to align your text to a baseline grid. You set the line height of the body text to a multiple of the base font size and then use that same multiple for the margin between elements. This way, everything lines up perfectly.

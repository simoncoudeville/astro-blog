If you want to design with large typography on the web there's no way around it, you'll have to implement a responsive type solution. Otherwise large text will get clipped or spill out of some design elements on smaller screens. However, combined with the zoom functionality on desktop browsers seemingly unpredictable jumps in font-size occur: zooming in appears to slow down or cease responding and in some cases text size even decreases when zooming in. Adrian Roselli has documented these behaviors in extend in <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/12/responsive-type-and-zoom.html">his article</a>. I wanted to understand the cause of these issues, so I wrote this article to share what I learned.

<Note title="A note on pixels">
  In all the examples and demos in this article I'm using pixels. This is
  because using relative units would make the calculations even more
  complicated. Pixels make it more intuitive to understand what's going on. And
  in the end, browsers compute everything into pixels anyway. But of course you
  should always use relative units in your code.

Responsive typography offers two techniques: static and fluid. Static responsive typography is based on a set of breakpoints, where each breakpoint triggers a new font size. This can be an effective way to ensure text looks good, but it is limited in that it only adjusts when the viewport crosses a breakpoint, while it ignores the changes between breakpoints. Fluid typography, however, allows for a more dynamic approach. It uses a mathematical formula to adjust font sizes as the viewport changes, allowing for a more natural display of typography across all viewport widths. Iâ€™ll look at both techniques and examine how they respond when zooming.

## What influences the eventual font-size

When applying a responsive type technique there 3 variables that influence the final computed font size of an element. Window width, viewport width and user preference font-size.

## What happens when zooming

Zooming on desktop based browsers changes the device pixel ratio. That's the ratio between CSS pixels and device pixels. For example: on a macbook's retina display the device pixel ratio is 2, meaning 1 CSS pixel is 2 device pixels. Zooming in increases the device pixel ratio, making CSS pixels larger. When you zoom in to 500% 1 CSS pixel is now 10 device pixels. The same CSS pixel value now represents an area 5 times larger on the screen. This is why zooming in makes everything larger, including text. Like I said, browsers compute everything to pixels, so if the font-size is expressed in pixels and pixels get larger, the text gets larger. The only exception is the viewport, which actually gets smaller. Because pixels are now 5 times larger there are now 5 times less pixels to fill up the viewport, making it 5 times smaller. So zooming in on to 500% on a 1920px wide window makes the viewport 1920px / 5 = 384px wide.

Here's a pixel to demonstrate this; try zooming in on it on a webkit or chromium based browser. On Chrome you can zoom in to 500%. At that point the pixel will be 5 times as wide. Take a screenshot and measure it if you don't believe me. I measured it myself and it's 5 times as wide.

import Pixel from "../../components/Demos/ResponsiveType/Pixel.svelte";

<Pixel />

If you're viewing this on firefox there's a good chance the pixel doesn't get larger. That's because Firefox has a setting to zoom text only. If you disable that setting zooming works the same as webkit and chromium browsers. When enabled there's some kind of black magic going on. I haven't figured out what it actually does and how this affects responsive typography.

That's why if you look at the computed font-size of an element after zooming in it won't have changed. The font-size is still the same, it's just the pixels that got larger. If you want to know what the visual font-size is you have to multiply it with the zoom level percentage. This also explains why zooming works when declaring everything in static pixels instead of relative units.

## Static responsive typopgraphy

Static responsive typography is based on a set of breakpoints, where each breakpoint triggers a new font size. I still find this to be an effective way to ensure text looks good. But it is limited because text adjusts when the viewport crosses a breakpoint, while it ignores the changes between those breakpoints, possibly causing an awkward gap where text might just be to small or large. Below is an example of how it works.

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
}

@media (min-width: 600px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 32px;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 48px;
  }
}
```

I created a simulator to test how this behaves when zooming in. You can zoom in and change the window width to see how the font-size changes. The font-size is displayed in the bottom left corner. The visual font-size is the font-size multiplied with the zoom level percentage. Notice how the viewport width decreases when zooming in and how it affects the font-size.

import Static from "../../components/Demos/ResponsiveType/Static.svelte";

<Static client:idle />

Try zooming in with a window width of 1680px. At first everything works fine, the
text increases in size. At a zoom level of 125% the visual font-size is 75px. At
a zoom level of 150% the viewport width is only 1120px wide so the the last media
query doesn't apply anymore. After that point the font-size decreases to 40px. But
with a zoom level of 150% the visual font-size is now 60px again. The same happens
at a zoom level of 300%. The viewport is now only 560px wide so the font-size of
the h1 is now only 20px, but with a zoom level of 300% the visual font-size is again
60px. So as you zoom in the visual font-size keeps turning back to 60px which gives
the impression that the text decreases in size as you zoom in.

You could potentially write a media query for each zoom level and downscale the font-size value so that multiplied with the zoom level the visual font-size wouldn't appear to change at
all. But only for a particular window width range. Because if you zoom in with a
larger window the viewport width after zoom is also larger, so the media queries
get triggered at different zoom levels. That's why it feels unpredictable and is
rather complex to test. You can see for yourself how it behaves with a larger window width by changing the window width in the simulator.

The values in this example are deliberately chosen to demonstrate the behavior and to make the effect clear. In reality you would probably use different breakpoints. But the result would remain the same: at some point the font-size decreases while the zoom level increases. Causing a somewhat broken experience.

## Fluid typography

Fluid typography uses the clamp function to grow the font-size as the viewport width increases. The clamp function takes a minimum, a desired value and a maximum. The value is clamped between the minimum and maximum. So if the value is smaller than the minimum the minimum is returned. If the value is larger than the maximum the maximum is returned. If the value is between the minimum and maximum the value itself is returned.

The most recent fluid typography technique uses a rather <a href="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/fluid-type-scale-with-css-clamp/">clever formula</a> to calculate the value between 2 breakpoints in the middle part of the clamp function. It also adds a rem value to the vw unit to make sure the font-size still scales when the user adjusts the font-size in the browser settings or when the user zooms. I created a calculator to test different values and combinations. You can try it out below.

import FluidCalculator from "../../components/Demos/ResponsiveType/FluidCalculator.svelte";

<FluidCalculator client:idle />

To test this formula I created another simulator to see how these variables influence the outcome after zoom. Try changing the window width first to see how the clamp function actually works. Then try zooming in to see how it affects the the middle part of the clamp function and the computed font-size after zoom. Next try changing the parameters in the calculator to see how it affects the rem value and the outcome.

import Fluid from "../../components/Demos/ResponsiveType/Fluid.svelte";

<Fluid client:idle />

Depending on the combination of parameters the result after zooming in is one of these 3 scenario's: Zoom keeps working but slows down, zoom stops working or negative zoom.

### 1. Zoom keeps working but slows down

Between the min and max font-size ranges the zoom level is still applied to the font-size. But it does so at a slower pace. The zoom level is applied to the font-size after it has already been decreased because the viewport gets smaller. Basically the zoom rate is still larger then the rate at which the font-size gets smaller. The larger the difference between the min and max font-size or the smaller the difference between the min and max viewport width the more the zoom level slows down. This is because the rem value after the vw value gets smaller. The smaller the rem value the less the zoom level can increase the font-size. At some point the rem value reaches zero and zoom stops working.

### 2. Zoom stops working

If the combination of parameters is such that the extra rem value after the vw part is zero zoom stops working when the middle part of the clamp function is activated. This is because the only value that's left now is the vw part. As you zoom in the viewport width decreases at the same rate as the zoom level increases. Because the font-size is now only expressed in vw the font-size decreases at the same rate as the viewport width. Every time the zoom level increases by 1% the viewport width decreases by 1%. So the font-size decreases 1% every time the zoom level increases by 1%, effectively canceling out each other.

Any combination of parameters that results in a rem value of zero after the vw part will cause this behavior.

This is always the case when the quotient (the result of the division) of the max and min font-size is the same as the quotient of the max and min viewport width. So for example a min font-size of 24px and a max font-size of 72px combined with a min viewport width of 320px and a max viewport width of 960px. The quotient of the max and min font-size is 3 and the quotient of the max and min viewport width is also 3.

I guess this is because of the nature of the formula.

### 3. Negative zoom

At that point

If the difference between the min and max font-size is smaller or the difference between the min and max viewport width is larger the extra value after the vw part reaches zero before the zoom level can increase the font-size. This is because the font-size gets smaller faster than the zoom level can increase it. At that point the zoom level is no longer applied to the font-size and zoom stops working.

When a com

In some situations the formula returns an extra value of 0. If that's the case there is essentially just the vw part that's
When the formula returns a point where the added

This could as well be seen as a feature and not a bug. Is it really broken? What looks more broken to you?

Everybody is looking at the maximum font-size. At a window width of 1680px the font-size without zooming is 48px so we expect that this value should increase according to the zoom level. But what if we didn't implement any responsive typography and just left the font-size at 32px? Zooming in to 400% would equal to a font-size of 128px. And there wouldn't be a problem. Using the fluid clamp formula zooming in to 400% would produce a font-size of 138px which is indeed only 287.5% of 48px but it's also 431.25% of 32px. So just because we chose to implement fluid typography there's now an accessibility problem.

As long as the computed font-size after zooming is larger than the minimum font-size I don't see a problem.
